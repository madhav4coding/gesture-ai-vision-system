# Gesture AI Vision System

A real-time computer vision project built using **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe** that allows hand-gesture interaction and basic fatigue detection through webcam input.

---

## Features
- Gesture-controlled mouse
- Air drawing board
- Blink & yawn based fatigue monitor

---

## Tech Stack
- Python
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- NumPy

---

## How It Works
The system captures webcam frames and processes them in real-time:
- Hand landmarks are used for cursor control and drawing.
- Facial landmarks are used to estimate blink rate and mouth opening duration.
- Different gestures switch between mouse mode, drawing mode, and study mode.
